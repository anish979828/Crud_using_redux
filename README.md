Usage
Once Todo App is running, you can start managing your tasks using the following steps:

On the Todo App homepage, you will see an input field where you can enter a task title.

Your task will appear in the task list below.

To mark a task as complete, click the checkbox next to it.

To edit a task, click the edit icon (pencil) next to the task. You can modify the task.

To delete a task, click the delete icon (trash can) next to the task.

Tasks will persist in the browser's localStorage, so you can close the application and reopen it later to find your tasks still intact.

The Redux state management ensures that your tasks are synchronized across components.
